My personal blog.
Based on [overreacted.io](https://github.com/gaearon/overreacted.io).
Syntax theme based on [Sarah Drasner's Night Owl](https://github.com/sdras/night-owl-vscode-theme/) with small tweaks.

To run locally, `yarn`, then `yarn dev`, then open https://localhost:8000.
Alternatively `npm install -g gatsby`, then `gatsby develop`.
