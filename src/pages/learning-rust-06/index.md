It's never a bad idea to slightly future proof our code while also making it also easier to maintain by breaking it apart.
Giving ourselves some room to re-use existing code will reduce future duplicate code and functions.

To help make it more flexible,
instead of printing out one through five,
letâ€™s take a number as input and print from one up to that value.

This means that a small refactor will be required in the `main.rs` file:
> src/main.rs
```rust
fn main() {
    numbers::print(5);
}

```

Let's keep changes to a minimum,
so aside from the above the only other modifications will be done to the `print` function.

We will implement `generate_sequence` helper function which will take a limit as an input and will output a vector,
while leaving `output_sequence` as is:
> src/lib.rs
```rust
// ...

fn output_sequence(numbers: &[u8]) {
    for n in numbers {
        println!("{}", n);
    }
}
```

Our print function can then just combine these two parts:

> src/lib.rs
```rust
pub fn print(limit: u8) {
    let numbers = generate_sequence(limit);
    output_sequence(&numbers);
}

// ...
```

In `print` we bind a variable to the result of calling `generate_sequence` with the `limit` passed to us as the argument,
then we call `output_sequence` as before passing a reference to a `slice` backed by the variable `numbers` we just created.

The new function `generate_sequence` takes an input argument, `limit`, and returns a `Vec<u8>`.
> src/lib.rs
```rust
// ...

fn generate_sequence(limit: u8) -> Vec<u8> {
    let mut numbers = Vec::new();
    for n in 1..=limit {
        numbers.push(n);
    }
    numbers
}

// ...
```

First we create a new vector with `Vec::new()` which by default is the same as one created with `vec![]`,
and does not allocate, so unless you actually put something into it, it does not use any memory.

> new() denotes by convention a function that returns a new instance of a type

In the code above, we see a new keyword being used, `mut`.

> Mutability is a property of the variable or reference not of the object itself.

We declare `numbers` to be a `mutable variable` that holds an `empty vector`.
This allows us to later call `numbers.push(n)` because `push` is a method that `requires the receiver to be mutable`.
Removing the mut from the let binding will result in a compiler error when we try to push.

In order to generate the numbers starting at `1` up to our `limit`, we use a `for loop`,
but this time the iterator is a `Range` object,
specifically an [InclusiveRange](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/struct.RangeInclusive.html).

> Ranges can be constructed with using the syntax `start..end` or `start..=end`.

Both start and end are optional, and if you have neither, i.e. .., then you also cannot have the = sign.
By default the range is `inclusive on the left` (i.e. includes start), and `exclusive on the right` (i.e. does not include end).

> The = after the two dots makes it so the range includes the end point.

**We want the numbers starting at 1 up to limit, including the limit, so we use 1..=limit.**

Ranges are frequently used when creating slices, for example:

```rust
    let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    let subset = &numbers[1..3];
```
Here subset is a slice of length 3-1=2 which starts at index 1, hence it is the slice [2, 3].

Iterating over this range,
we push each value onto the end of our vector which causes heap allocations every time there is not enough capacity to extend the length.

Finally, we want to return this vector from our function.

The final expression in a `generate_sequence` function (`numbers`) is implicitly returned so there is no need for an explicit return statement.

However, note the lack of semicolon at the end of the last line of this function.

> The expression that evaluates to the vector numbers is written without a semicolon and means to return that value.

> If we had written a semicolon, that would be a statement whose value is () which is not what you want to return.

This is a common error so the compiler is smart enough to tell you what to fix, but it is nonetheless an error.

> You can use a return statement to return early from a function,
> but using the last expression of the block as the implicit return is idiomatic Rust.

Next, let's have a look at one of the many powerful generic programming facilities available in Rust.
